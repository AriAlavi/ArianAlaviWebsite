                As you may have seen on the home page, I like hiking and backpacking. It can be difficult since I don't have a car but I can still find ways to get into nature - I've even hitchhiked from a campsite before.

                I also enjoy reading philosophy whenever I find the time, although I seem to have less time for it than I used to. I think one of the most important things that you can do is ask yourself why you're doing what you're doing and really dig deep and understand the meaning behind your life.

                I also like to play video games, usually strategy ones. My favorites genres are strategy games, grand strategy games, and tactical shooters. Some examples are: Squad, Rimworld, and Europa Universalis 4.
